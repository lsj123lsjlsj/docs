# Power Supply Options

Radxa E54C supports 12V power input, with a recommended current of 2A or above to ensure stable operation when all peripherals are connected. We have tested the following adapter models:

- [Radxa DC12 36W Adapter](https://radxa.com/products/accessories/power-dc12-36w) (recommended)
- Standard 12V/3A DC adapter (5525 connector)
- Other compatible 12V/3A or higher power adapters

Note: E54C only supports 12V input, do not use a 5V power supply. This is different from E52C's power requirements.
