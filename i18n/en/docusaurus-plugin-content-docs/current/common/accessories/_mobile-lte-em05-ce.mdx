The following is the procedure of {props.product} using the Mobile LTE EM05-CE module.

## Quectel LTE EM05-CE Physical Image

- The 4G module demonstrated here is: Quectel EM05-CE

    style={{ width: "80%" }}
  />

## Connecting Peripherals

First of all, you need to plug the Quectel LTE EM05-CE into the B-key connector of {props.product} and insert the SIM card.

- The installation position is as shown in the figure:

  <img
    src={props.b_key_installation}
    alt="Quectel EM05-CE installation"
    style={{ width: "80%" }}
  />

- The SIM card slot location and insertion direction is shown in the figure:

  <img
    src={props.sim_installation}
    alt="Quectel EM05-CE SIM slot"
    style={{ width: "80%" }}
  />

You can check if the device is connected with the following command:

<pre>
  radxa@{props.model}:~$ lsusb | grep -i Quectel Bus 002 Device 002: ID
  2c7c:0125 Quectel Wireless Solutions Co. EC25 LTE modem
</pre>

The modem usually communicates with the host via the serial port. Please check that the system enumerates the corresponding serial devices correctly:

<div>

{props.children}

</div>

## Installing related software

Execute the following commands in the terminal to install dial-up related software:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ppp picocom net-tools
```

## Testing the modem with the `at` command

First, open the serial port with `picocom`:

```bash
sudo picocom -b 115200 /dev/ttyUSB3
```

After the programme has started, the modem status can be checked by entering the following `at` command:

```bash
at+cpin?
+CPIN: READY

OK  #Check if the SIM card is in place

at+csq
+CSQ: 31,99

OK  #Detects signal, 99 means no signal.

at+cops?
+COPS: 1,0,"CHN-UNICOM",7

OK  #View Operator

at+creg?
+CREG: 0,1

OK  #Get the registration status of the mobile phone (0,1: indicates that the registration is normal)

at+qeng="servingcell"
+QENG: "servingcell","NOCONN","LTE","FDD",460,01,19A358C,366,100,1,5,5,774E,-108,-5,-83,9,13

OK  #Displays the signal strength and quality of the currently connected service cell
```

If the modems all return to normal, use the `Ctrl+A Ctrl+X` key combination to exit `picocom`.

## Dial-up via `ppp'

In a terminal, execute the following command to switch to the `peers` directory and add the `ppp` dial-up configuration script.

```bash
sudo su
cd /etc/ppp/peers
```

Use the `vi` editor to add the first script file, `rasppp`, which looks like this:

```bash
# Hide password when connecting for debugging
hide-password

# Don't need authentication for this phone
noauth

# For call control scripts
connect '/usr/sbin/chat -s -v -f /etc/ppp/peers/rasppp-chat-connect'

# for disconnect scripts
disconnect '/usr/sbin/chat -s -v -f /etc/ppp/peers/rasppp-chat-disconnect'

# Debugging information
debug

# 4G module
/dev/ttyUSB3

# Serial baud rate
115200

# Use default route
defaultroute

# Do not use default IP
noipdefault

# do not use PPP compression
novj
novjccomp
noccp
ipcp-accept-local
ipcp-accept-remote
local

# It is best to lock the serial bus by creating a lock file so that other programs will know that the corresponding serial port is already in use once they discover the existence of this file.
lock
dump

nodetach

# username password (configuration varies by operator)
user ctnet@mycdma.cn
password vnet.mobi

# hardware control flow
crtscts
remotename 3gppp
ipparam 3gppp

# Set the usepeerdns parameter if you want to use the DNS negotiated on the server side.
usepeerdns
```

Add a second script, `rasppp-chat-connect`, which looks like this:

```bash
TIMEOUT 15
ABORT "BUSY"
ABORT "ERROR"
ABORT "NO ANSWER"
ABORT "NO CARRTER"
ABORT "NO DIALTONE"

""AT
OK \rATZ

ok \rAT+CGDCONT=1, "ip",""

ok-at-ok atdt#777
CONNECT \d\c
```

Add a third script file `rasppp-chat-disconnect` with the following script:

```bash
ABORT "ERROR"
ABORT "NO DIALTONE"
SAY "\NSending break to the modem\n"

""\k""

""+++ATH""
SAY "\nGood bye ! \n"
```

After adding the above three script files, you can now try dialling using `ppp`:

```bash
sudo pppd call rasppp & # dialling in the background
```

The complete dialling process is shown in the image.

<img src={props.diallingI} alt="Dialling process I" style={{ width: "80%" }} />

<img
  src={props.diallingII}
  alt="Dialling process II"
  style={{ width: "80%" }}
/>

From the output of the program we can get the following information:

1. local IP address: `10.5.65.99
2. Primary DNS server: `202.96.128.86` 3. Secondary DNS server: `10.5.65.99` 4.
3. Secondary DNS server: `202.96.134.133`.

We can now configure the network based on the above information:

```bash
sudo ip route add default via 10.224.236.90 # configure the gateway
echo "nameserver 120.80.80.80" | sudo tee -a /etc/resolv.conf # configure primary DNS
echo "nameserver 221.5.88.88" | sudo tee -a /etc/resolv.conf # Configure secondary DNS
```

You can now use the `ping` command to check if you are connected to the Internet:

<img src={props.ping_successfully} alt="ping successfully" />

## Troubleshooting

1. My system does not list USB serial devices.

Please check if the corresponding driver is included in your current running system. You can run the following command to check:

```bash
radxa@rock-3b:~$ lsmod | grep usb
usb_wwan 20480 1 option
usbserial 36864 2 usb_wwan,option
```
